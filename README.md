### Overview
The Corner Grocer Tracker is a C++ program designed to help a grocery store analyze the frequency of items purchased throughout the day. It processes item data from a daily transaction log, providing insights that assist in optimizing the store layout for better customer experience and sales. Key functionalities include searching for item frequencies, displaying all items with their frequencies, generating a histogram of these frequencies, and backing up data.

### Reflections 
This project aimed to solve the problem of inefficient item placement in the Corner Grocer store by providing a detailed analysis of item purchase frequencies. Understanding these patterns allows the store to rearrange its layout strategically to enhance customer shopping experience and potentially increase sales.

I excelled at implementing a clean, efficient map data structure to track item frequencies effectively. The use of maps facilitated quick lookups and insertions, which was crucial for handling the input data dynamically. The program could be enhanced by integrating a graphical user interface (GUI) to make it easier for non-technical store staff to use. Also, by using a method that allows the program to handle multiple tasks at the same time, it could process large amounts of data faster.

The most challenging part was generating the histogram display. Ensuring that the histogram accurately represented the data required careful calculation of string lengths and output formatting. I overcame these challenges by consulting documentation and forums, and by experimenting with different string manipulation techniques.

Skills such as file handling, use of data structures like maps, and generating reports from data are widely applicable to many software development tasks across various domains. These skills are fundamental for developing applications that require data analysis, user input, and presenting information in a readable format.

To ensure maintainability and readability, I followed best coding practices such as using meaningful variable names, maintaining consistent coding style, and adding detailed comments explaining the logic behind major steps. For adaptability, I structured the program with scalability in mind, using modular functions that can be easily modified or expanded upon for additional features like new types of data analysis or different input/output formats.
